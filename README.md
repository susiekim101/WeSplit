# WeSplit

A simple SwiftUI application that allows users to input a check, party size, and tip percentage to evenly split the total cost among the number of people. 
WeSplit utilizes @State, Form, and Picker properties to make the UI interactive, yet simple to use.
This project follows the 100 Days of Swift curriculum, led and instructed by Paul Hudson.
